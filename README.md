# hello-world
I am new to github and don't know how to code(I am 12 years old....). I hope you will help me.
Uh...... I love eating and sleeping(well i think everyone does). I am a little awkward and shy so I prefer being alone(in short an inrovert). 
But i do love adventures and I am really funny(or atleast that's what my friends think). Even though I am shy, I am a really open person once you get to know me.
